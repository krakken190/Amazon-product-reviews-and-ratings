# Amazon-product-reviews-and-ratings

Excited to share my latest data science project analyzing Amazon product reviews and ratings! Thanks to Fabian Werkmeister for the fantastic idea to work on this dataset.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: 🔍
▪ The dataset consisted of over 37,000 Amazon product reviews across multiple categories.
▪ The average rating was 4.2 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment.
▪ The top 3 most reviewed categories were electronics, books, and home & kitchen.
▪ Sentiment analysis showed that the majority of reviews had a positive sentiment, with neutral and negative reviews making up a smaller proportion.

▪ Data Engineering:- 1.Entagled the category column. 2.Cleaned the text of product name, reviews and description.

▪ Data Analytics:- 1. Descriptive statistics on reviews, sales across the categories. 2. Analyzed the number of discounts and average percent per category.

▪ Data Science:- 1.Trained the machine learning model to classify sentiments of review

▪ Preprocessing steps included adding new columns for review length and word count, as well as statistical analysis to identify outliers and check for data integrity.
▪ Catcodes were used to convert categorical data into numerical data.
▪ Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was used for tokenization, tagging, and chunking to extract key features and entities from the reviews.
▪ The VADER and RoBERTa models were utilized for sentiment analysis, and the results were compared and visualized using bar plots.
